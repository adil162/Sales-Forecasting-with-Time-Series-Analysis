# Sales-Forecasting-with-Time-Series-Analysis

📊 Sales Forecasting with Time Series Analysis
By Mentoga through Skilled Score

A comprehensive project that integrates traditional time series models with advanced machine learning techniques to accurately forecast sales and support data-driven business decisions.

🧾 Project Summary
This project focuses on forecasting daily sales from 2015 to 2025 using a combination of:

📈 Traditional Time Series Models: ARIMA, Simple Exponential Smoothing

🤖 Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

🔄 Ensemble Learning: Combines strengths of all models for superior forecast accuracy

The analysis reveals strong seasonal trends, business growth patterns, and achieves accurate 30-day forward predictions using time series cross-validation.

🛠️ Libraries Used
Data Processing: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Time Series: statsmodels, pmdarima

ML Models & Evaluation: sklearn, xgboost

Model Persistence: joblib

🔍 Analysis & Methodology
📊 Data Exploration & Decomposition
Sales data shows an upward trend and yearly seasonality

Decomposition highlights trend, seasonal, and residual components

ADF test confirms non-stationarity; differencing applied

🧠 Forecasting Techniques
Model Type	Description
ARIMA	Captures trend and seasonality via auto-parameter selection
Simple Exponential Smoothing	Smooths data for basic forecasts
Linear Regression	Baseline model using temporal and lag features
Random Forest	Captures non-linear relationships and seasonality
XGBoost	Gradient boosting for powerful short-term accuracy
Ensemble Model	Combines all above models for optimal performance

📅 Feature Engineering
Temporal indicators (day of week, month, weekend)

Rolling means & standard deviations (7-day window)

Lag features (previous week’s sales)

Removal of low-variance features

📈 Model Performance
Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE

5-Fold Time Series Cross-Validation ensures robust testing

Ensemble model showed lowest error and best overall forecast performance

💼 Business Insights
Growth Detection: Clear increase in sales trend over 10 years

Seasonal Awareness: Enables smarter inventory and workforce planning

Deployment Ready: Models saved using joblib, ready for production use

Recommendation: Regular retraining and feature monitoring advised

🚀 Future Improvements
Introduce deep learning (LSTM, Prophet)

Add metadata (promotion events, holidays, store info)

Implement real-time dashboard (e.g. Streamlit, Dash)

Monitor model drift and automate retraining pipeline
